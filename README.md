This exists for me to learn about using GitOps.
Specifically: 
* setting up a repo that uses a "protected main branch"
* technical procedures for using a PR to effect change to a repo protected in this manner
	* branch, making the changes
	* Build a PR
	* Approving the PR
	* Tagging a new release
* What automations are available? (explore GH actions)
